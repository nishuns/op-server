### Op-server

It is the backend application of a sample project which I had created a year ago, it is based on node express and mongodb

#### Steps how to run

1. Clone the repository
2. run the command ```npm install```
3. fill .env accordingly
4. Now enter ```npm run dev```


And that's it. raise a issue if you have any problem.
